# Reach4Help Logo

![](logo-compat.svg)

Our logo uses an inkscape mesh gradient, which unfortunately is not yet part
of the SVG standard, and does not display in most svg viewing software.

To mitigate this, we have a version `logo-compat.svg` where the gradient
meshes have been exported as bitmaps,
and the shape boundaries use a mask to keep a nice clean line and prevent
pixellation.
