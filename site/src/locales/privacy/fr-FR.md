# Our Commitment to Your Privacy

Here at Reach4Help, the privacy of our users is very important. We want you to understand how and why Reach4Help collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online services or when you otherwise interact with us or receive communication from us.

## What data do we collect and how?

We currently collect contact details for each user who uses our systems. We collect data from people when they browse our website, use our platform, contribute to our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/reach4help/), receive or send e-mail with us, chat with us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/reach4help/shared_invite/zt-dfw74tza-3kB82faJgZMZObQ_x~gadg), and opt in to marketing messages.

## What do we use your data for?

We use this data to keep Reach4Help running, to help us improve Reach4Help, to give personalised support and to send marketing messages (but only if you tell us to).

## How do we protect your data?

We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.

## Where do we store your data?

The personal data we collect is processed in any data processing facilities operated by the third parties identified below.

## What third parties process your data?
