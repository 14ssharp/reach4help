## Team

We are a team of volunteers from around the world, spanning Bangladesh to London and LA to Portugal, united by one goal: to help people during the global crisis. Having felt helpless in finding help for ourselves and our loved ones during the pandemic, we set out to solve that.

<br/>

This project started under [Helpful Engineering](https://www.helpfulengineering.org/), a collective of volunteers working together to come up with solutions during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, without any commercial goals.
