## Our Mission

Reach4Help is an open project that is completely run by volunteers that aims to address issues like providing an easier access to groceries, medicine, or a simple help to walk the dogs for those who canâ€™t do it at the moment.

<br />

**OUR GOAL** is to enable those in need to receive help, and enable partner groups and organizations to help more efficiently, by mobilizing their volunteers with the help of our own system.
