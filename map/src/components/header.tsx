        In hopes of helping folks find and join in a mutual aid effort where
        they live, offering inspiration to start your own, and/or simply lifting
        your spirits, below is a growing list of mutual aid pandemic disaster
        care (with the acknowledgment that place-names are a colonial
        imposition). Note: Each project is autonomous and self-organized; they
        all use public links, so be wary of putting info on these links that you
        donâ€™t want to be public too.
