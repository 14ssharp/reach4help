# MVP Workflow

Rough outline of the planned workflow for the MVP:

*Volunteer*
- Users can register to volunteer using Facebook ID login (restricting users with accounts created for less than 6 months). If the user doesn't have Facebook we can provide and email for them to contact but we shouldn't waste too much time in this phase;
- User will be notified of cases near to them (eventually in real-time push notifications); they can then pick them up or not do anything; we might filter the notification messages inside of the app to only show the cases that are still open at the moment the user opens the notifications menu;
- Once the user understands the request is met, they can close the case as solved.
- User should agree to have their name and rating be public (+rep).
 
*Person In Need (PIN)*
- User can register via phone number. We confirm with SMS/verification code;
- Onboarding process to register person, address, etc. If registration is for another person it might be a good idea to add a phone number to call in case of request assignment. For example to enable an elder person to receive a phone call by the volunteer assigned to its request;
- Create request;
- Be notified when request is assigned;                   
  - Extra step asking if PIN wants to accept volunteer
- Receive their requested goods/care. Volunteer should have the power to change the request status to solved, but PIN has final say. 
  - If the PIN has access to the app (e.g. is not elderly/owns a smartphone) they can confirm the status change. 
  - If the PIN cannot do the status confirmation via app, follow up to verify if the request was fulfilled.
